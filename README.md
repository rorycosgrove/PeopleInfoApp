# PeopleInfoApp
Write A WPF app with a single main window. The app should get data about people from a data source and display a list with their names and dates of birth in the main window.
Clicking on a list item should result in the details of the person being shown in the main window too. The details should include name, date of birth and profession.
Users should be able to edit, add and delete people and save changes back to the data source. The list of people in the main window should reflect the up-to-date state of the data source.
It is fine to assume that the user never types invalid data, so there is no need of validation and all the fields can be strings, including date of birth.
There is no need to implement a real database or web-service. It is fine to fake the data source in memory and not persist data when the app exits. However, the code should be designed to allow using real data source in future with minimal changes.
The code should have good unit test coverage.
The task should demonstrate knowledge of software engineering principles and design patterns. You may be asked to discuss the decisions you made in building the app.
Please submit the completed code to GitHub (or another web site) and provide us the link.
